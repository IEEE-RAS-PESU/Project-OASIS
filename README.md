# Project-OASIS

+ [Google Sheets API](https://github.com/IEEE-RAS-PESU/Project-OASIS/tree/main/Google%20Sheets%20API) contains code to read and write data from a Google sheet.
+ [OpenCV](https://github.com/IEEE-RAS-PESU/Project-OASIS/tree/main/OpenCV%20Basics) contains code to turn on live feed, draw a rectangle and other basics of OpenCV.
+ [Color](https://github.com/IEEE-RAS-PESU/Project-OASIS/tree/main/Color%20Detection) and [Contour](https://github.com/IEEE-RAS-PESU/Project-OASIS/tree/main/Contours) Detection are used to detect colours and contours respectively.
+ [Face Recognition](https://github.com/IEEE-RAS-PESU/Project-OASIS/tree/main/Face%20Recognition) uses Haar Cascade to recognise a face in the frame.
+ [QR Code](https://github.com/IEEE-RAS-PESU/Project-OASIS/tree/main/QR%20Code) generates a QR Code with custom text embedded in it.
+ [Arduino](https://github.com/IEEE-RAS-PESU/Project-OASIS/tree/main/Arduino) covers Obstacle Avoidance and the code for Ultrasonic Sensor.

#### This repository contains code covered in the videos covering each concept respectively. This is for Project OASIS by IEEE RAS PESU RR.
